/// What an actor wants the runtime to do after handling a command.
///
/// The runtime owns persistence and state transitions; an actor expresses its
/// intent by returning one of these rather than mutating state directly. State
/// only ever changes by folding persisted events through
/// [`EventSourcedActor::apply_event`], guaranteeing that live operation and
/// crash recovery follow the exact same path.
///
/// An effect is one persist step (possibly empty) followed by an ordered set of
/// post-persist actions — snapshot, ack, stop — that the runtime runs only after
/// the durable write. Modelled as composable fields rather than one variant per
/// combination (à la Akka's `Effect.persist(e).thenRun(..).thenReply(..).thenStop()`),
/// so e.g. "persist + snapshot + ack" needs no new variant. Build with the
/// constructors ([`none`](Self::none), [`persist`](Self::persist),
/// [`snapshot`](Self::snapshot), [`stop`](Self::stop)) and chain post-actions with
/// [`and_snapshot`](Self::and_snapshot), [`and_ack`](Self::and_ack),
/// [`and_stop`](Self::and_stop).
